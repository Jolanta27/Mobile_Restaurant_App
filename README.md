Project I made on the course to train my React Native skills.

1.You have to download Node and npm on your computer. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the LTS version of Node.
If you install Node, npm comes automatically with Node

2.You have to install the Expo globally. Install the global expo-cli tools to the new location by running 

npm install expo-cli --global. Then you have to make your own api key to get data.

3.After the tools finish installing, run npm start. The Metro Bundler should open in your browser.
